The dockerfiles are explicitly set up to build a *ROS1 Melodic or ROS2 Foxy* image as these were used during development. However, these versions can easily be changed by editing the dockerfile and stating any other version to be required. This would involve changing only a minor subset of one line for each of the dockerfiles. Specifically: *FROM ros:foxy* to *FROM ros:eloquent* or any other alteration involving a **correct** ROS version. **NOTE**: that the respective ROS1 and ROS2 dockerfiles are created with a purpose, as their correct setup for robot-runner to be able to run, involve different steps. Therefore only alter the ROS1 dockerfile to any other ROS1 version, and do the same for the ROS2 dockerfile.
