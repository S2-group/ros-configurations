# ROS Configuration

This repository shares preset configurations for ROS to be used in our experiments on robotics software.

## [Docker](./ros-configuration/docker/)

There we make public some Dockerfiles for running ROS (1 and 2) on your computer so you can "talk" to the robotic system.

## [RaspberryPi](./ros-configuration/raspberrypi)

It contains an Unbuntu Bionic (18.4) image that can be used to run ROS(1 and 2) on both, Raspberry Pi 3 and 4. The main ideia is to use it as TurtleBot3's main computer (Raspverry Pi 3B+ is the current official of TurtleBot3 Burger and Waffle Pi).
