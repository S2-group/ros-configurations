# ROS Configuration

This repository shares preset configurations for ROS to be used in our experiments on robotics software.

## [Docker](./docker/)

There we make public some Dockerfiles for running ROS (1 and 2) on your computer so you can "talk" to the robotics system.

## [RaspberryPi](./raspberrypi)

It contains an Unbuntu Bionic (18.4) image that can be used to run ROS(1 and 2) on both, Raspberry Pi 3 and 4. The main ideia is to use it as TurtleBot3's main computer (Raspverry Pi 3B+ is the current official of TurtleBot3 Burger and Waffle Pi).

## [Simulation/Experiment Tools](./gazebo-sim/)

There you will find instructions of how to run simulations on Gazebo, ROS/ROS2, and Robot Runner.
